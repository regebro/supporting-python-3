A note on terminology
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The process of switching to Python 3 is most often called "porting". The first
two editions of this book was also called "Porting to Python 3". However,
this gave the false impression that this was a lot of work, and that Python 3
was "a different language" than Python 2. Although moving to Python 3 can be
hard work, for the most time it is not, and as Python 2.5 and Python 3.2 are
rapidly falling out of use, it gets even easier.

For that reason, I changed the name of the book to "Supporting Python 3" as this
better reflects the effort. It's not porting, the vast majority of your code
will work with no changes, or changes that can be done automatically with 2to3.

I have tried to avoid using the word "porting" in the text as a part of this.
